# City Information

## Description

As professional developers, we created a google map that consists of cities that you can visit. We provided informative details about each city such as the air quality, UV index, average gas pricing within selected city, longtitude and latitude. Our motivation for creating this project was to help those that are visiting major cities. The most important thing we learned was how to work as an efficient team and bring about a project that works.
